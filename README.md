Extract monthly weather history from freemeteo (https://freemeteo.co.id/)

I use beautifulsoup for scrapping and pandas for creating csv file. The data in csv not yet cleaned (in this repo I enclose the csv file). The city is still manually set, in this case I set it to Jakarta.

How to use:
- git clone https://github.com/gitenx/getweather_freemeteo.git
- cd getweather_freemeteo
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python get_weather.py

Enjoy it.
